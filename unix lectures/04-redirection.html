			<p> The cat (short for “concatenate“) command is one of the most frequently used command in Unix. cat command allows us to create single or multiple files, view content of file, concatenate files and redirect output in terminal or files. </p>
			<p> We use the > symbol to redirect the output of a command. cat <i>filename </i> displays the contents of a file on screen. we can move this output in a file rather than to be displayed on screen</p>

			The symbol | is the Unix pipe symbol that is used on the command line. What it means is that the standard output of the command to the left of 				the pipe gets sent as standard input of the command to the right of the pipe. Note that this functions a lot like the > symbol used to redirect 			the standard output of a command to a file. However, the pipe is different because it is used to pass the output of a command to another command, 				not a file.

			A filter is a Unix command that does some manipulation of the text of a file. Two of the most powerful and popular Unix filters are the sed and awk commands. Here is a simple way to use the <strong>sed</strong> command to manipulate the contents of the apple.txt file. First we have displayed the contents of lists.txt file then in the second command we passed the contents of lists.txt file to sed command, which replaced first occurance of e in each line with WWW and displayed output on screen. In the second run of sed command we have made all ocurrances of e as J by adding /g switch to the sed command.

		</div>


		
		<br>
		<div class="panel panel-default" style="border-left: 6px solid #646D7E;">
  			<div class="panel-body">
    				$ cat lists.txt <br>
				core <br>
				worm seed <br>
				jewel <br><br>
				$ cat apple.txt | sed -e "s/e/WWW/" <br>
				corWWW <br>
				worm sWWWed <br>
				jWWWwel <br><br>
				$ cat apple.txt | sed -e "s/e/J/g"<br>
				corJ<br>
				worm sJJd<br>
				jJwJl<br>
				$  
				
  			</div>
		
		</div>
		<p> Note that sed command doesn't do any change in the file. It only do changes in display.</p>
		<br><br>
				<div>
			
			<p>
		
		
			<strong> awk </strong> is another powerful filter. We can use awk to manipulate the contents of a file. Here is an example. In the first command contents of class.txt are displayed. Then in the second command we have passed the contents of class.txt to the awk command using pipe. awk command uses = as a separator and it prints all text before = appears in each line. In third command similarly we took all text after =.
