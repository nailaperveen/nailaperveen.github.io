	  	<div ng-bind="section1">Everything in UNIX is either a file or a process. A process is an executing program identified by a unique PID (process 				identifier). A file is a collection of data. They are created by users using text editors, running compilers etc. A file usually have an 				extension to show the type of data it contains. Examples of files: a document (report, essay etc.), the text of a program written in some 				high-level programming language instructions comprehensible directly to the machine and incomprehensible to a casual user, for example, a 				collection of binary digits (an executable or binary file); a directory, containing information about its contents, which may be a mixture of 				other directories (subdirectories) and ordinary files.</div>

		<div>
			<h4><span class="label label-warning">The Directory Structure</span></h4>
			<p ng-bind="dirstr">All the files are grouped together in the directory structure. The file-system is arranged in a hierarchical structure, like 				an inverted tree. The top of the hierarchy is traditionally called root (written as a slash / ). To access home or root directory we usually 				write /home/user-name</p>

			<p ng-bind="dirstrr">In the diagram above, we see that their is a home directory named root which contains three sub-directories products, 				resources and services, which in turn contains other sub directories.To access a directory we will follow the complete path started from root.

The shell’s main disadvantages are its primarily textual nature and how cryptic its commands and operation can 				be.</p>

			<p>This command returns the name of the user. Here in this case we are assuming that the user name of this computer is esha. Now we try

			<h4><span class="label label-warning">Process</span></h4>
			<p >
				When we execute a program on a UNIX system, the system creates or starts, a new process for that program. for example when we run whoami command to find the name of the system user, a new process is started. Operating system provides a unique identity to each process known as pid or process ID. A process, in simple terms, is an instance of a running program.

			</p>

			<p >
				
				To find out how many processes are running at any time we can use ps command
			</p>
		</div>

		</div>

		<br><br>
		<div>
			
			<p> We can run process in background or in foreground. By default each process runs as foreground process that is it takes its input from keyboard and sends its output to the monitor. While a foreground process is in progress we can not run any other command until it ends. For long processes it wastes resources. The advantage of running a process as background is that we can perform other tasks too.</p>

		<p> To run a proces as background we add & at the end.

			<p> 
				To terminate a foreground process we can press ctrl+c. But to terminate a background process we first need to find out the  id of that process using ps command and then we can use kill command to terminate it.

			<h4><span class="label label-warning">Parent and Child Processes</span></h4>
			<p >
				Each unix process has two ID numbers assigned to it: Process ID (pid) and Parent process ID (ppid). Each user process in the system has a parent process.

Most of the commands that we run have the shell as their parent. Run ps -f command which lists both process ID and parent process ID.
