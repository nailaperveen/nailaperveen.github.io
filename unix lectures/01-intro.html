By operating system, we mean the suite of programs which make the computer work. It is a stable, multi-user, multi-tasking system for servers,desktops and laptops.UNIX systems also have a graphical user interface (GUI) similar to Microsoft Windows which provides an easy to use environment. However, knowledge of UNIX is required for operations which aren't covered by a graphical program.</p>

				<li class="list-group-item" ng-bind="archlst2">Shell: The shell is the utility that processes your requests.

What’s special about it is that 				its job is to run other programs rather than to do calculations itself.
